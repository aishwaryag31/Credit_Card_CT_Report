# Credit Card Report Dashboard

## Project Overview
The Credit Card Report Dashboard is an interactive Power BI tool designed to provide insights into customer demographics, transaction trends, and revenue performance. It enables businesses to identify key revenue drivers, track customer behavior, and optimize decision-making processes based on data analysis. The dashboard leverages SQL databases and Power BI visualizations to transform raw data into actionable insights.

## Import Data to SQL Database
To prepare the data for analysis, I created two SQL tables: one for customer details and another for credit card transaction details. The customer table includes attributes like customer age and income, while the transaction table includes details such as annual fees, transaction amounts, and interest earned. The data was then imported from CSV files into these tables.
